## Lab 10 - Revision Exercise - Theory Questions

The following is a compilation of theory questions from past exams. 

A lot of the questions relate to Java Programming and syntax which isn't going to be in the exam directly (you'll have to write Java code of course but we won't ask you questions about syntax). They're also of a different style to the questions you'll be asked in the exam.

### Question 1

What is the output of the code below?

<img src="imgs/Quiz01_Q1.gif">

<ol type="a">
    <li>Fred</li>
    <li>Bob</li>
    <li>null</li>
    <li>empty string</li>
</ol>

### Question 2

Suppose the following two classes are defined:

```java
public abstract class Figure {...}
public class Rectangle extends Figure {...}
public abstract class 3DFigure extends Figure {...}
```

Which of the following instantiations is not valid?

<ol type="a">
    <li><code>Rectangle r = new Rectangle(…..);</code></li>
    <li><code>Figure f = new Rectangle(….);</code></li>
    <li><code>Figure f = new 3DFigure(…);</code></li>
</ol>

### Question 3

Using the class diagram below, examine the code that follows and choose which of the following statements below does not compile?

<img src="imgs/Quiz01_Q3.gif">

```java
Employee e = new Director();
Analyst a = new Analyst();
Manager m = new Director();
```

<ol type="a">
    <li><code>e.addEmployee()</code></li>
    <li><code>m.addEmployee(a);</code></li>
    <li><code>((Director)m).approveExpense(10000)</code></li>
</ol>

### Question 4

The code below produces a compilation error. Examine the code and choose the fix that will enable the classes to compile.

```java
public class Account {
    private double balance;
    public Account (double balance) { this.balance = balance; }
    // other getter and setter for balance
}
public class Savings extends Account {
    private double interestRate;
    public Savings(double rate) {
        this.interestRate = rate;
    }
}
```

<ol type="a">
    <li>Call the setBalance method of the Account from Savings</li>
    <li>Change the access of interestRate to public</li>

    <li>During method overriding, the overridden method in the sub-class can specify a weaker access modifier </li>
</ol>

### Question 9

Choose the incorrect statement

a. The principle of least knowledge reduces dependencies between objects and promotes loose coupling

b. The code below is a good example of the principle of least knowledge

```java
Driver driver = car.getDriver()
Address driverAddress = driver.getAddress()

An online camping store, sells different kinds of camping equipment. Items selected by the customer are added to a shopping cart.

The calculation logic for each item type varies, and we want to move all the calculation logic to one separate class, to decouple the different items from the calculation logic applied on them.

You are implementing a health application that monitors heart rate of a patient. If the heart rate of a patient is out of the required range, the application needs to inform all the relevant doctors and nurses. Doctors and nurses responsible for a patient may change over time.

### Question 24

A user bought an application that reads data in JSON format, and displays results on a web page. Later, the user realised that one of their data sources is in XML format. Unfortunately, the user does not have access to the source code of the application, so it is not possible to change the application.

### Question 25

### Question 26

Briefly explain the important differences between the Factory Method and Abstract Factory Method Patterns, as discussed in the lectures.
