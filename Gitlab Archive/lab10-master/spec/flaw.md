## Lab 10 - Choice Blogging - The Flaw in the Plan

Listen to the podcast [which you can find here](spec/flaw-v2.mp4) for some background and context.

Once you've done this, think of a time when something went wrong - it could be anything - it just has to be a time when there was a flaw in the plan. 

Write a blog post of a couple of paragraphs reflecting on this and describe:
1. What happened (the general situation)
2. The bad outcome that arose as a result of the flaw/s
3. What the flaw/s in the design were
4. How they might have been prevented and what you learned from that experience.

Make your blog post public and post it on the Megathread. Comment on a couple of other people's posts if you want to.
