### How would you write tests for Game with the default constructor that prove the battle function works as expected?
Knowing that the default constructor for the Game class using the current time stamp, tests would be dependent on their execution time. Possible implementations may include trigger tests at a given future time stamp (i.e. setting time explicitly to maintain the deterministic nature of tests). Specifying time tags would help ensure that the system time is simulated.
