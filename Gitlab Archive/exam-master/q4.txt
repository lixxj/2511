The push implementation of the Observer Pattern is present in the scenario.
In the scenario, the release of tickets is an observable and Webster and other people are observers.
Webster has setup notifications on his phone, so he can get this information directly when the observable object notify all the subscribed observers.
Therefore, this is push implementation.
