## Lab 10 - Choice Blogging - Narrative Design âœ¨

[Watch this video](https://youtu.be/uzO77dk5SRE?t=794), it's part of a lecture from an older version of this course. 

We have seen from this lab that design is something that is central across all levels of abstraction - at the code level, at the function level, at the class level and the system level. The subjectivity of design makes it an art form, like that of narrative and literature. The video gives an example of this in the rendition of *The Two Towers*.

Think of a story, movie or TV show that you enjoy that exhibits good narrative design. Inside a Wiki Page on WebCMS, write down what parts you think make the story well designed. When writing, think also of the commonalities between the narrative and other narratives (structurally, stylistically) and note down some of the 'design patterns' the narrative contains. Your post doesn't have to be a literature essay (though you can if you like), just some simple observations and appreciation.

Make your blog post public and post it on the Megathread. Comment on a couple of other people's posts if you want to.
