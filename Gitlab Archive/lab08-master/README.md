## Overview

The overall class mark for each week is out of 8 marks. 2 marks come from tutorial participation and 6 marks come from completing the following exercises.

## Core Exercises & Blogging

In order to achieve full marks for the lab, you will need to complete the following core exercises:

* [JQL](spec/jql.md) (6 marks) - This is quite a large lab exercise that consists of several parts. Think of it like an actual laboratory session in physics or chemistry. You will need to do some pre-reading (watch the video) as well as a writeup (blog post reflection). We recommend you set aside 3 hours to complete this exericse.

## Choice Exercises & Blogging

* [Tribute](spec/tribute.md)

## Submission

To submit, make a tag to show that your code at the current commit is ready for your submission using the command:

```bash
$ git tag -fa submission -m "Submission for Lab 08"
$ git push -f origin submission
```

Or, you can create one via the GitLab website by going to **Repository > Tags > New Tag**.
We will take the last commit on your master branch before the deadline for your submission.
