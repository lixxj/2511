- Violation of Law of Demeter - CourseOffering.java:58-59
- LSP reveals hidden problems in the inheritance structure between Course and Course Offering
- Opacity (unnecessary complexity) in CourseOffering.java:checkValidEnrolment()


## Other inaccuracies
- Missing getter/setter methods for private attributes in Student.java
